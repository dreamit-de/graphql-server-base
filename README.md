## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @dreamit/graphql-server-base
```

TypeScript declarations are provided within the project.

**Note:**

If you want to publish your own extension it is advised to install **@dreamit/graphql-server-base** as **peerDependency**. This way you can define which version range your extension supports and it might be usable in multiple major versions of [@dreamit/graphql-server][1] (if they depend on the same range of this base module).
Example in package.json for peerDependencies:

```json
"peerDependencies": {
    "@dreamit/graphql-server-base": "^1.0.0"
}
```

## Compatibility

**@dreamit/graphql-server-base** is compatible with [graphql-js][2] version ^16.0.0 and [funpara][3] version ^1.0.0. For compatibility with [@dreamit/graphql-server][1] please check **Compatibility** section in the **graphql-server** readme.

## Content of this base module

All content of this module is exported in the root **index.ts** file. This means you can import it using an import statement like

```typescript
import { MetricsClient } from '@dreamit/graphql-server-base'
```

### Constants

In **error/ErrorNameConstants.ts** constants to identify/display errors are provided. In **request/ContentType.ts** the content type used by [@dreamit/graphql-server][1] is available as enum.

### Interfaces

Interfaces for creating your own **Logger** or **MetricsClient** are available in this module. Additionally, the interfaces used by [@dreamit/graphql-server][1] for handling requests and responses are provided.

## Example

The following example shows how a **NoLogger** implementation of the **Logger** interface could be implemented.

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@dreamit/graphql-server-base'

/**
 * Logger implementation that does not log anything.
 */
export class NoLogger implements Logger {
    loggerName: string
    serviceName: string
    debugEnabled = false

    constructor(loggerName: string, serviceName: string, debugEnabled = false) {
        this.loggerName = loggerName
        this.serviceName = serviceName
        this.debugEnabled = debugEnabled
    }

    debug(logMessage: string, context?: unknown): void {}
    logDebugIfEnabled(message: string, context?: unknown): void {}
    error(
        logMessage: string,
        error: Error,
        customErrorName: string,
        context?: unknown,
    ): void {}
    info(logMessage: string, context?: unknown): void {}
    warn(logMessage: string, context?: unknown): void {}
}
```
